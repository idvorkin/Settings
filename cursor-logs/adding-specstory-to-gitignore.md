I'll help you add `.specstory` to the gitignore file. First, let me check if a `.gitignore` file exists in your workspace.

I found the main `.gitignore` file in your workspace. Let me check its current contents to make sure we don't add a duplicate entry.

I'll now add `.specstory` to the `.gitignore` file. I'll add it in a new line after the existing entries.

```diff
  .aider*
  .env

+ .specstory
  
```

I've added `.specstory` to your `.gitignore` file. This means Git will now ignore any files with the `.specstory` extension in your repository. The change has been applied successfully.
