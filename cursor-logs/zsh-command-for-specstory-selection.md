## SpecStory

## Zsh Command for Specstory Selection (2/15/2025, 5:00:11 AM)

_**User**_

Add a zsh command to copy a specstory stored in

‚ùÆ ls -al --sort date {gitroot}/.specstory/history/

To cursor logs, but select it using fzf, listed in date order, and include the file previews

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a Zsh function to copy a specstory using fzf with file previews. First, let me check the existing Zsh configuration files to see where best to add this function.

Read file: shared/zsh_include.sh

I see this is a good place to add our new function. Let me create a function to copy specstory files using fzf. I'll add it to the shared Zsh include file.

---

_****_

```diff
  }
  
- 
- 
+ function copy_specstory() {
+     local git_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
+     if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
+         echo "Error: Not in a git repository"
+         return 1
+     fi
+ 
+     local spec_dir="$git_root/.specstory/history"
+     if [[ ! -d "$spec_dir" ]]; then
+         echo "Error: .specstory/history directory not found in git root"
+         return 1
+     }
+ 
+     # Use fzf to select a file, showing files in reverse date order with preview
+     local selected_file=$(ls -t "$spec_dir" | \
+         fzf --preview "cat $spec_dir/{}" \
+             --preview-window=right:70% \
+             --height=80%)
+ 
+     if [[ -z "$selected_file" ]]; then
+         echo "No file selected"
+         return 0
+     fi
+ 
+     # Copy the selected file to cursor logs
+     cp "$spec_dir/$selected_file" "$HOME/cursor-logs/"
+     echo "Copied $selected_file to ~/cursor-logs/"
+ }
  
  safe_init
```

I've added a new function called `copy_specstory` to your Zsh configuration. Here's what it does:

1. Finds the git root directory using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
2. Checks for the existence of the `.specstory/history` directory
3. Uses `fzf` with the following features:
   - Shows files in reverse date order (newest first) using `ls -t`
   - Displays a preview of the file content on the right side (70% width)
   - Uses 80% of the terminal height for the selection window
4. Copies the selected file to your `~/cursor-logs/` directory

You can now use this function by typing `copy_specstory` in your terminal. The function will:
- Show you a list of specstory files in date order
- Let you interactively search through them
- Show a preview of each file as you move through the list
- Copy your selection to the cursor logs directory

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

Oops git_root/cursor_logs

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the `copy_specstory` function to use the git root directory for the cursor logs instead of the home directory. Let me update that.

---

_****_

```diff
      fi
  
-     # Copy the selected file to cursor logs
-     cp "$spec_dir/$selected_file" "$HOME/cursor-logs/"
-     echo "Copied $selected_file to ~/cursor-logs/"
+     # Create cursor-logs directory in git root if it doesn't exist
+     local cursor_logs_dir="$git_root/cursor-logs"
+     mkdir -p "$cursor_logs_dir"
+ 
+     # Copy the selected file to cursor logs in git root
+     cp "$spec_dir/$selected_file" "$cursor_logs_dir/"
+     echo "Copied $selected_file to $cursor_logs_dir/"
  }
  
```

---

_****_



I've updated the `copy_specstory` function to:
1. Create a `cursor-logs` directory in the git root if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the selected specstory file to `{git_root}/cursor-logs/` instead of `~/cursor-logs/`
3. Update the success message to show the actual destination path

The function will now properly copy the selected specstory file to the cursor-logs directory in your git repository root. Would you like me to make any other adjustments?

Run Sodot to reload it 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll run the Sodot command to reload the Zsh configuration.

---

_****_

```bash
. ~/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh
```

```
idvorkin@igors-Mac-mini settings % . ~/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh
/Users/idvorkin/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh:677: parse error near `local'
idvorkin@igors-Mac-mini settings %
```

---

_****_



I see there's a syntax error in the script. The error is related to a `local` declaration. Let me fix that by correcting the syntax in the `copy_specstory` function.

---

_****_

```diff
          echo "Error: .specstory/history directory not found in git root"
          return 1
-     }
+     fi
  
      # Use fzf to select a file, showing files in reverse date order with preview
```

---

_****_



Now let's try running Sodot again to reload the configuration:

---

_****_

```bash
. ~/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh
```

```
idvorkin@igors-Mac-mini settings % . ~/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh

```

---

The configuration has been successfully reloaded! The `copy_specstory` function is now available with the fixed syntax and will copy selected specstory files to the cursor-logs directory in your git repository root. You can now use the function by typing `copy_specstory` in your terminal.

The unalias warnings are normal and not a concern - they just indicate attempts to remove aliases that weren't set in the first place.

List of files should be iwhat's in the history directory but it's wshowing what in the gitroot directory, e.g. 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. The `ls -t` command is being run in the wrong directory. Let me fix the `copy_specstory` function to properly list files from the `.specstory/history` directory.

---

_****_

```diff
  
      # Use fzf to select a file, showing files in reverse date order with preview
-     local selected_file=$(ls -t "$spec_dir" | \
-         fzf --preview "cat $spec_dir/{}" \
+     local selected_file=$(cd "$spec_dir" && ls -t | \
+         fzf --preview "cat {}" \
              --preview-window=right:70% \
              --height=80%)
```

---

_****_



The changes I made:
1. Changed the listing command to first `cd` into the spec directory before running `ls -t`
2. Simplified the preview command since we're now in the correct directory

Let's reload the configuration:

---

_****_

```bash
. ~/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh
```

```
‚ùØ . ~/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh
++safe_init
++zfunc
--zfunc

Now when you run `copy_specstory`, it should properly show you the list of files from the `.specstory/history` directory instead of the git root directory. The files will be shown in reverse chronological order (newest first) and you'll be able to preview their contents before selecting one to copy.

Fix

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue - we should use `eza` (the modern replacement for `ls`) with the proper sorting flag. Let me fix that:

---

_****_

```diff
  
      # Use fzf to select a file, showing files in reverse date order with preview
-     local selected_file=$(cd "$spec_dir" && ls -t | \
+     local selected_file=$(cd "$spec_dir" && eza --sort newest | \
          fzf --preview "cat {}" \
              --preview-window=right:70% \
```

Let's reload the configuration:
