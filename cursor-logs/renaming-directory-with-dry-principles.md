1/ Lets rename from cursor-logs to chop-logs, make taht change DRY

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the code to rename the directory from `cursor-logs` to `chop-logs`. Since this directory name appears multiple times in the functions, I'll make the change in a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) manner by introducing a variable for the directory name.

Let me edit the file:

---

_****_

```diff
      defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add '{"LSHandlerURLScheme" = "https"; "LSHandlerRoleAll" = "net.kassett.finicky";}'
  }
+ 
+ # Define the logs directory name once
+ CHOP_LOGS_DIR="chop-logs"
  
  function specstory-save() {
      fi
  
-     # Create cursor-logs directory in git root if it doesn't exist
-     local cursor_logs_dir="$git_root/cursor-logs"
-     mkdir -p "$cursor_logs_dir"
+     # Create logs directory in git root if it doesn't exist
+     local logs_dir="$git_root/$CHOP_LOGS_DIR"
+     mkdir -p "$logs_dir"
  
-     # Copy the selected file to cursor logs in git root
-     cp "$spec_dir/$selected_file" "$cursor_logs_dir/"
-     echo "Copied $selected_file to $cursor_logs_dir/"
+     # Copy the selected file to logs directory in git root
+     cp "$spec_dir/$selected_file" "$logs_dir/"
+     echo "Copied $selected_file to $logs_dir/"
  }
  
      fi
  
-     # Create cursor-logs directory in git root if it doesn't exist
-     local cursor_logs_dir="$git_root/cursor-logs"
-     mkdir -p "$cursor_logs_dir"
+     # Create logs directory in git root if it doesn't exist
+     local logs_dir="$git_root/$CHOP_LOGS_DIR"
+     mkdir -p "$logs_dir"
  
-     # Copy the latest file to cursor logs in git root
-     cp "$spec_dir/$latest_file" "$cursor_logs_dir/"
-     echo "Copied $latest_file to $cursor_logs_dir/"
+     # Copy the latest file to logs directory in git root
+     cp "$spec_dir/$latest_file" "$logs_dir/"
+     echo "Copied $latest_file to $logs_dir/"
  
      # Just add the file to git
-     git -C "$git_root" add "cursor-logs/$latest_file"
+     git -C "$git_root" add "$CHOP_LOGS_DIR/$latest_file"
      echo "Added $latest_file to git staging area"
  }
```

I've made the following changes to make the code more DRY:

1. Added a constant `CHOP_LOGS_DIR` at the top level to define the logs directory name in one place
2. Updated all instances of `cursor-logs` to use the `$CHOP_LOGS_DIR` variable
3. Made the variable names in the functions more generic (changed `cursor_logs_dir` to `logs_dir`)
4. Updated all the comments to be more generic by removing specific references to "cursor logs"

The changes maintain all the existing functionality but make it easier to change the directory name in the future - you only need to update the `CHOP_LOGS_DIR` variable value. This follows the DRY principle by having a single source of truth for the directory name.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to these changes?

Source it to make sure no bugs

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you source the file to test the changes. Let me run the source command:

---

_****_

```bash
source ~/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh
```

```
++safe_init
++zfunc
--zfunc
++eval
--eval
--safe_init
++default_init
default_init:unalias:10: no such hash table element: image
default_init:unalias:91: no such hash table element: ddg
Random
default_init:unalias:135: no such hash table element: a
--default_init

igors-Mac-mini in settings on ÓÇ† master [$!?] via Óúò v23.2.0 via üêç v3.13.0 (py) on ‚òÅÔ∏è   
‚ùØ
```

---

_****_



The file has been sourced successfully. The output shows the expected initialization sequence:
1. `safe_init` ran successfully
2. `default_init` ran successfully
3. The unalias warnings are normal and not related to our changes (they're trying to unalias commands that weren't aliased)

The changes we made to rename from `cursor-logs` to `chop-logs` using the `CHOP_LOGS_DIR` variable appear to be working without any errors. The functions `specstory-save`, `specstory-git-latest`, and `specstory-view-latest` should now be using the new directory name.

Would you like to test any of the specific functions to verify they're working as expected with the new directory name?
