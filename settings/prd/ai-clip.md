# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AI-Clip Tool

## Status: Draft

## 1. Introduction

AI-Clip is a command-line tool that provides AI-powered clipboard text processing using GroqCloud's fast inference capabilities. The tool enables users to quickly transform, fix, and enhance clipboard content through natural language commands, seamlessly integrating with Alfred workflow for rapid access.
