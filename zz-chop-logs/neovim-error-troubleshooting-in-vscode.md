## NeoVim Error Troubleshooting in VSCode (2/27/2025, 6:11:51 AM)

_**User**_

Running NeoVIM in vscode I'm getting htis 

nvim_set_current_win: BufEnter Autocommands for "*md": Vim:E492: Not an editor command: :SoftPencil. Can you figure out why

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you figure out why you're getting the error with NeoVim in VSCode. Let me investigate this issue.

First, let's search for any relevant configuration files that might be causing this error. The error mentions `:SoftPencil` which is likely related to a plugin or configuration.

Great, I found some Neovim configuration files. Let's first check the main `init.vim` file to see if it contains any references to SoftPencil:

---

_****_

Read file: nvim/init.vim

---

_****_



Now let's check the VSCode-specific Neovim configuration file:

---

_****_

Read file: nvim/vscode-init.vim

---

_****_



Let's also check the main .vimrc file since it's being sourced in the init.vim:

Let's search for any files that might contain references to SoftPencil:

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "SoftPencil" • **2** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/settings/default_vimrc` | L530 | `" Always enable softpencil` |
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/settings/default_vimrc` | L532 | `autocmd BufEnter *md :exe ":SoftPencil"` |
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/settings/_ivim.rc.vim` | L329 | `" Always enable softpencil` |
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/settings/_ivim.rc.vim` | L334 | `autocmd BufEnter *md :exe ":SoftPencil"` |

</details>

Now I found the issue! Let's look at the `default_vimrc` file to understand how SoftPencil is being used:

---

_****_

Read file: default_vimrc

Let's also check if there's a plugin for SoftPencil installed:

Let's try a different search approach:

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "vim-pencil" • **4** files</summary>

</details>

Now I understand the issue. Let me check how the vim-pencil plugin is loaded in Neovim:

---

_****_

Read file: nvim/nvim_plugins.lua

Based on my investigation, I've found the issue with your NeoVim in VSCode setup. Here's what's happening:

1. You have an autocmd in your `default_vimrc` file (line 532) that tries to run the `:SoftPencil` command whenever you open a Markdown file:
   ```vim
   autocmd BufEnter *md :exe ":SoftPencil"
   ```

2. The SoftPencil command comes from the vim-pencil plugin (`reedes/vim-pencil`), which is installed in your Neovim configuration.

3. When you're running NeoVim in VSCode, it seems the plugin isn't being properly loaded or initialized before the autocmd tries to use it.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Modify your VSCode-specific Neovim configuration**:
   You can edit your `nvim/vscode-init.vim` file to either:
   - Explicitly load the vim-pencil plugin
   - Or disable the autocmd for Markdown files when running in VSCode

2. **Use a conditional in your autocmd**:
   Modify the autocmd in your `default_vimrc` to check if the SoftPencil command exists before trying to use it:
   ```vim
   autocmd BufEnter *md if exists(":SoftPencil") | :exe ":SoftPencil" | endif
   ```

3. **Create a VSCode-specific configuration**:
   Since VSCode has its own text editing capabilities, you might want to disable certain Vim plugins when running in VSCode integration mode.

Would you like me to help you implement one of these solutions? I can create a fix for your configuration files.

_**User**_

Lets do 1

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify your VSCode-specific Neovim configuration to explicitly load the vim-pencil plugin. Let's first check the current content of your vscode-init.vim file:

---

_****_

Read file: nvim/vscode-init.vim

---

_****_



Now I'll edit the vscode-init.vim file to explicitly load the vim-pencil plugin before the SoftPencil command is used:

---

_****_

```diff
  :echo "hello"
  lua nvim_shared.lua
+ 
+ " Explicitly load vim-pencil plugin for VSCode integration
+ if exists('g:vscode')
+   " Load vim-pencil plugin
+   packadd vim-pencil
+   
+   " Initialize vim-pencil with default settings
+   let g:pencil#wrapModeDefault = 'soft'
+   
+   " Define SoftPencil command if it doesn't exist
+   if !exists(':SoftPencil')
+     command! -nargs=0 SoftPencil call pencil#init({'wrap': 'soft'})
+   endif
+ endif
  
  
```

---

_****_





Now let's also check how Neovim loads plugins to make sure our approach is compatible with your setup:

---

_****_

Read file: nvim/nvim_init.lua

---

_****_





Let's also check the VSCode-specific Lua file:

---

_****_

Read file: nvim/nvim_vscode.lua

---

_****_







Now I have a better understanding of your setup. Let's create a more comprehensive solution by modifying both the vscode-init.vim file and adding a check in the nvim_vscode.lua file:

---

_****_

```diff
  " Explicitly load vim-pencil plugin for VSCode integration
  if exists('g:vscode')
-   " Load vim-pencil plugin
-   packadd vim-pencil
+   " Try to load vim-pencil plugin
+   silent! packadd vim-pencil
+   
+   " Check if vim-pencil is loaded
+   if !exists('g:loaded_pencil') && filereadable(expand('~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/vim-pencil/plugin/pencil.vim'))
+     source ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/vim-pencil/plugin/pencil.vim
+   endif
    
-   " Initialize vim-pencil with default settings
+   " Initialize vim-pencil with default settings if loaded
+   if exists('g:loaded_pencil')
      let g:pencil#wrapModeDefault = 'soft'
-   
-   " Define SoftPencil command if it doesn't exist
-   if !exists(':SoftPencil')
-     command! -nargs=0 SoftPencil call pencil#init({'wrap': 'soft'})
+   else
+     " Define a dummy SoftPencil command if vim-pencil is not available
+     command! -nargs=0 SoftPencil echom "vim-pencil plugin not loaded"
    endif
  endif
```

---

_****_







Now, let's also modify the nvim_vscode.lua file to ensure the vim-pencil plugin is properly loaded in VSCode:

---

_****_

```diff
  vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)
  local keymap = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap
+ 
+ -- Load essential plugins for VSCode integration
+ require("lazy").setup({
+ 	"reedes/vim-pencil", -- Ensure vim-pencil is loaded in VSCode
+ }, {
+ 	defaults = {
+ 		lazy = false,
+ 	},
+ })
+ 
+ -- Initialize vim-pencil if loaded
+ vim.cmd([[
+   if exists('g:loaded_pencil')
+     let g:pencil#wrapModeDefault = 'soft'
+   else
+     command! -nargs=0 SoftPencil echom "vim-pencil plugin not loaded"
+   endif
+ ]])
  
  function SetupVSCode()
```

---

_****_









I've implemented a comprehensive solution to fix the issue with the SoftPencil command in VSCode:

1. **Updated vscode-init.vim**:
   - Added code to try loading the vim-pencil plugin
   - Added a fallback to source the plugin directly if needed
   - Created a dummy SoftPencil command if the plugin isn't available to prevent errors

2. **Updated nvim_vscode.lua**:
   - Added explicit loading of the vim-pencil plugin using Lazy.nvim
   - Added initialization code for vim-pencil
   - Added a fallback command if the plugin isn't loaded

This solution should resolve the error you're seeing when running NeoVim in VSCode. The key changes:

1. We're now explicitly loading the vim-pencil plugin in VSCode mode
2. We've added fallback mechanisms to handle cases where the plugin might not load properly
3. We've created a dummy SoftPencil command as a last resort to prevent errors

To test this solution:

1. Restart VSCode
2. Open a Markdown file with NeoVim
3. The error should no longer appear

If you still encounter issues, you might need to check:
- The exact location of your vim-pencil plugin (it might be in a different directory)
- Whether your VSCode NeoVim extension is properly loading the configuration files

Would you like me to make any additional changes to the solution?

Now this: 

nvim_set_current_win: BufEnter Autocommands for "*md": Vim(call):E117: Unknown function: AutoCorrect

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. You're encountering a new error related to the `AutoCorrect` function. The error message indicates that when you open a Markdown file, Neovim is trying to call the `AutoCorrect` function, but it can't find it.

Let's look at the autocmd that's causing this issue:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "AutoCorrect" • **3** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/settings/default_vimrc` | L180 | `Plugin 'panozzaj/vim-autocorrect'` |
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/settings/default_vimrc` | L533 | `autocmd BufEnter *md :exe ":call AutoCorrect()"` |
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/settings/nvim/lazy-lock.json` | L82 | `"vim-autocorrect": { "branch": "master", "commit": "28ef54d5cdd2d1021d54c90d80eb1a7d02fb58bc" },` |
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/settings/nvim/nvim_plugins.lua` | L56 | `"panozzaj/vim-autocorrect",` |

</details>

---

_****_





Just as I suspected! Similar to the SoftPencil issue, there's an autocmd in your `default_vimrc` that's trying to call the `AutoCorrect` function from the `vim-autocorrect` plugin, but the plugin isn't being loaded in VSCode mode.

Let's update the VSCode-specific configuration to handle this as well:

---

_****_

```diff
  lua nvim_shared.lua
  
- " Explicitly load vim-pencil plugin for VSCode integration
+ " Explicitly load plugins for VSCode integration
  if exists('g:vscode')
    " Try to load vim-pencil plugin
      command! -nargs=0 SoftPencil echom "vim-pencil plugin not loaded"
    endif
+   
+   " Try to load vim-autocorrect plugin
+   silent! packadd vim-autocorrect
+   
+   " Check if vim-autocorrect is loaded
+   if !exists('*AutoCorrect') && filereadable(expand('~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/vim-autocorrect/plugin/autocorrect.vim'))
+     source ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/vim-autocorrect/plugin/autocorrect.vim
+   endif
+   
+   " Define a dummy AutoCorrect function if the plugin isn't available
+   if !exists('*AutoCorrect')
+     function! AutoCorrect()
+       echom "vim-autocorrect plugin not loaded"
+     endfunction
+   endif
  endif
  
```

---

_****_









Now let's also update the nvim_vscode.lua file to include the vim-autocorrect plugin:

---

_****_

```diff
  require("lazy").setup({
  	"reedes/vim-pencil", -- Ensure vim-pencil is loaded in VSCode
+ 	"panozzaj/vim-autocorrect", -- Ensure vim-autocorrect is loaded in VSCode
  }, {
  	defaults = {
      command! -nargs=0 SoftPencil echom "vim-pencil plugin not loaded"
    endif
+   
+   " Define a dummy AutoCorrect function if the plugin isn't available
+   if !exists('*AutoCorrect')
+     function! AutoCorrect()
+       echom "vim-autocorrect plugin not loaded"
+     endfunction
+   endif
  ]])
  
```

---

_****_









I've updated both configuration files to handle the `AutoCorrect` function issue:

1. **In vscode-init.vim**:
   - Added code to try loading the vim-autocorrect plugin
   - Added a fallback to source the plugin directly if needed
   - Created a dummy AutoCorrect function if the plugin isn't available to prevent errors

2. **In nvim_vscode.lua**:
   - Added the vim-autocorrect plugin to the Lazy.nvim setup
   - Added a fallback dummy AutoCorrect function if the plugin isn't loaded

This solution should resolve both errors you're encountering when running NeoVim in VSCode:
1. The "Unknown command: SoftPencil" error
2. The "Unknown function: AutoCorrect" error

The approach is similar to what we did for the SoftPencil issue - we're making sure the plugins are loaded if possible, and providing fallbacks when they're not.

To test this solution:
1. Restart VSCode
2. Open a Markdown file with NeoVim
3. The errors should no longer appear

If you encounter any other similar errors with different plugins, you can follow the same pattern:
1. Identify the plugin that provides the missing command/function
2. Add it to the Lazy.nvim setup in nvim_vscode.lua
3. Add fallback code in vscode-init.vim

Is there anything else you'd like me to help with?

I no longer have syntax highlighting did you install the plugins correctly? Was there an existing lazy you should be using instead

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. It looks like we might have disrupted your plugin loading system. Let's investigate how your plugins are normally loaded and fix the configuration.
