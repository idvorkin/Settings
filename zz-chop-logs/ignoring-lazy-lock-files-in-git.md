_**Assistant**_

I'll help you set up Git to ignore the lazy-lock file. First, let's check if there's already a .gitignore file in your workspace.

Great! I can see that you already have a .gitignore file in your workspace. Let's check its contents to see if we need to add the lazy-lock entry.

_****_

Read file: .gitignore

Let me check the rest of the .gitignore file to see if lazy-lock is already included:

---

_****_

Read file: .gitignore

Now I'll add the lazy-lock entry to your .gitignore file:

---

_****_

```diff
  
  .specstory
+ 
+ lazy-lock.json
  
```

I've successfully added `lazy-lock.json` to your .gitignore file. This will prevent Git from tracking the lazy-lock.json file in your repository. 

If you already have a lazy-lock.json file that's currently being tracked by Git, you might want to remove it from the Git index without deleting the file itself. You can do this by running:

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right, I should always use `/bin/cat` when running commands that might invoke a pager. Let me check the Git status properly:

```bash
git status | /bin/cat
```

```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .gitignore

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

I can see that you've already got the modified `.gitignore` file with the `lazy-lock.json` entry added. Now you need to commit this change to make it effective.

If you already have a `lazy-lock.json` file that
