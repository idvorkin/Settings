# Point ai-fix to ai-clip path (2025-06-08 11:32:35)

_**User**_

Grr Grr - Need to point ai-fix directly it's here $HOME/.local/bin/ai-clip , use homedir env variable  @ai_clip.py

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue! The `ai_fix()` and `ai_rhyme()` commands in `y.py` are trying to call `ai-clip` directly, but it's installed at `$HOME/.local/bin/ai-clip`. Let me fix this by using the home directory to construct the correct path.

---



---



---

Perfect! I've fixed both the `ai_fix()` and `ai_rhyme()` commands in `y.py` to use the correct path to the `ai-clip` command. Now instead of trying to find `ai-clip` in the system PATH, both commands will:

1. Use `Path.home()` to get the home directory (which resolves to `$HOME` in your case)
2. Construct the full path to `~/.local/bin/ai-clip`
3. Call the command using the full path

This should resolve the "command not found" issue you were experiencing with the AI commands.

HYmn can you DRY tha tcode? 


---

_**Assistant**_



---

Absolutely! I can see there's a lot of repeated code between `ai_fix()` and `ai_rhyme()`. Let me create a helper function to DRY it up.

---



---

Perfect! I've DRYed up the code by:

1. **Created a helper function `_call_ai_clip()`** that handles all the common logic:
   - Constructing the path to `ai-clip`
   - Running the subprocess with the given command
   - Handling success/error cases
   - Print formatting

2. **Simplified both commands** to just call the helper with their specific parameters:
   - `ai_fix()` calls `_call_ai_clip("fix", "ðŸ¤– Fixing clipboard text with AI...")`
   - `ai_rhyme()` calls `_call_ai_clip("seuss", "ðŸŽ­ Transforming clipboard text to Dr. Seuss style...")`

This eliminates all the duplicate code while maintaining the same functionality. Now if you need to add more AI commands or modify the common behavior (like error handling or path construction), you only need to change it in one place!

It looks like the `ai-clip` command is running but returning an error with no stderr output. This could be due to missing environment variables (like `GROQ_API_KEY`) or clipboard access issues when running from Alfred. Let me add some debugging to help identify the issue:

---



---

Now the function will provide much better debugging information. It will check for:

1. **File existence**: Whether `ai-clip` actually exists at the expected path
2. **Environment variable**: Whether `GROQ_API_KEY` is set (required by the AI script)
3. **Detailed error info**: Shows the exit code and both stdout/stderr when there's an error

The most likely issue is that the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable isn't available when running from Alfred. You'll need to either:

1. **Set the environment variable globally** in your shell profile (`.zshrc` or similar)
2. **Add it to Alfred's environment** if Alfred has that capability
3. **Or modify the ai-clip script** to read from a config file instead of environment variables

Try running the command again and it should give you a clearer picture of what's failing!

You're right load the env variable via the way it's done here @zsh_include.sh 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Perfect! I can see how the environment variables are loaded in `zsh_include.sh`. The `export_secrets()` function uses `esecret_jq()` to read from `~/gits/igor2/secretBox.json`. Let me modify the `_call_ai_clip` function to load the `GROQ_API_KEY` the same way:

---



---

Perfect! Now the `_call_ai_clip` function will:

1. **First check** if `GROQ_API_KEY` is already in the environment (from shell sessions where `export_secrets()` was called)
2. **If not found**, load it from `~/gits/igor2/secretBox.json` using the same approach as `esecret_jq()` 
3. **Set the environment variable** so the `ai-clip` subprocess will have access to it
4. **Provide clear error messages** if the file or key isn't found

This mirrors exactly how the `zsh_include.sh` handles loading secrets, but works within the Python script when called from Alfred (where the shell environment variables aren't available). Now your AI commands should work properly from Alfred!
