# Render pop-up on completion in ui corner (2025-06-14 14:47:45)

_**User**_

Have ai-fix render a pop up when done by calling ui corner @ux.py 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**User**_

Just assume it's in the path by callable via ux

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the `ai_fix` command in `y.py` to call `ux corner` when the AI processing is complete. Looking at the current implementation, I need to add a call to the `ux` command after the `ai-clip` command completes successfully.

---



---

_**User**_

Render for 1 second 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll change the duration from 3 seconds to 1 second for the popup notification.

---



---

Perfect! Now when you run `ai_fix`, it will:

1. Process the clipboard text with AI to fix spelling and grammar
2. Show a corner popup notification saying "AI Fix Complete! âœ¨" for 1 second when done

The popup will appear in the top-right corner of your screen as a brief confirmation that the AI processing has completed.

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

How can I help you today? Are you looking to make more changes to your Python scripts, or do you have something else in mind?

Use same path as ai-clip command, DRY the py-tools-path

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll extract the ai-clip path into a reusable variable to follow DRY principles. Looking at the code, I can see the path is used in the `_call_ai_clip` function.

---

Read file: py/y.py

---

Now I'll create a constant for the Python tools path and update both the `_call_ai_clip` function and the `ai_fix` command to use it:

---



---



---



---

Perfect! I've successfully applied the DRY principle by:

1. **Created a constant** `PY_TOOLS_PATH = Path.home() / ".local" / "bin"` at the top of the file
2. **Updated `_call_ai_clip` function** to use `PY_TOOLS_PATH / "ai-clip"` instead of the hardcoded path
3. **Updated `ai_fix` command** to use `PY_TOOLS_PATH / "ux"` for the popup notification

Now both the `ai-clip` and `ux` commands use the same base path, making it easier to maintain and modify if the tools directory ever changes. The code is more DRY and consistent.

_**User**_

Use center instead of corner

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll change the popup notification from corner to center positioning.
