## Adding Tail Functionality to tigrc (3/2/2025, 5:19:15 PM)

_**User**_

Have chopp git latsets do a tail of hte file after the git add, maybe last 20 lines

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user's query is a bit unclear, but it seems like they want to modify a tigrc file to add a feature related to git operations, specifically to show a tail of a file (last 20 lines) after a git add operation.

Looking at the attached file, it's a tigrc configuration file which configures the behavior of tig, a text-mode interface for git. The file contains various settings and key bindings for tig.

The user's request "Have chopp git latsets do a tail of hte file after the git add, maybe last 20 lines" seems to be asking to add a new key binding or functionality to the tigrc file that would show the last 20 lines of a file after a git add operation.

Let me edit the file to add this functionality.</think>I'll edit your tigrc file to add a key binding that shows the last 20 lines of a file after git add.

<think>It seems like I need to clarify what the user is asking for. The query mentions "chopp git latsets" which might be a typo or a specific command or configuration the user wants to add. The user wants to set up a command that shows the tail of a file (last 20 lines) after a git add operation.

Let me try to understand what the user might be asking for:

1. It's likely about adding a custom command or shortcut in tigrc
2. The command should execute after a git add operation
3. It should show the last 20 lines of a file that was added

Let me read the tigrc file first to understand the current configuration better.</think>I apologize for the confusion. Let me better understand what you're asking for. Are you looking to:

1. Add a key binding in your tigrc file that will display the last 20 lines of a file after you've run git add?
2. Or

chop-git-latest is a zsh command

_**Assistant**_

<think>I misunderstood the request. The user is referring to a command called "chop-git-latest" which is a zsh command. The request is about modifying this command to show the last 20 lines of a file after git add.

To help with this task, I should:
1. First check if this command exists in their zsh configuration files
2. Modify the command to include the functionality to display the last 20 lines of a file after git add</think>I understand now - you want to modify a zsh command called "chop-git-latest" to show the last 20 lines of a file after git add. Let me search for this command in your zsh configuration files.

<think>Let me search for zsh configuration files in the user's settings directory and then look for the chop-git-latest command.</think>Let me search for zsh configuration files in your settings directory.

Let me check if there are any zsh-specific configuration directories.

Let's look at the zsh include files where we might find this command:

Perfect! I found the `chop-git-latest` function starting on line 650. Now I'll modify it to show the last 20 lines of the file after the git add operation:

---

_****_

```diff
      git -C "$git_root" add "$CHOP_LOGS_DIR/$latest_file"
      echo "Added $latest_file to git staging area"
+     
+     # Show the last 20 lines of the file
+     echo "Last 20 lines of the file:"
+     tail -20 "$logs_dir/$latest_file"
  }
  
```

I've successfully updated the `chop-git-latest` function in your `zsh_include.sh` file. Now, after the function adds the file to the git staging area, it will:

1. Print a header saying "Last 20 lines of the file:"
2. Show the last 20 lines of the copied file using the `tail -20` command

This change allows you to quickly see the end content of the file after it's been added to git, which can be helpful for verification or reference.

To apply this change in your current shell session, you can source the file:

```
source ~/settings/shared/zsh_include.sh
```

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
