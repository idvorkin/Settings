@bootstrap.sh Lets add a mpv config files so we can set default paramaters.  See how I do it for like yazi

I'll help you add mpv config files setup to the bootstrap script, following the same pattern you use for yazi and other config directories.

Let me first check what's currently in your config directory and then create the mpv config setup:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory config ‚Ä¢ **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÅ `yazi` |
| üìÅ `mcphub` |
| üìÅ `cursor` |
| üìÅ `carapace` |
| üìÅ `yabai` |
| üìÅ `bat` |
| üìÅ `borders` |

</details>

---

Now let me check if there's already an mpv directory:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "mpv" ‚Ä¢ **7** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

I don't see any existing mpv config directory. Let me create the mpv config directory and a basic config file, then add the symlink to bootstrap.sh:

---

```bash
mkdir -p config/mpv
```

```
?‚ûú  settings git:(master) ?‚úó 

```

---

Now let me create a basic mpv.conf file with some useful default settings:

---

```diff
- 
+ # mpv configuration file
+ 
+ # Video
+ vo=gpu
+ hwdec=auto
+ profile=gpu-hq
+ 
+ # Audio
+ audio-file-auto=fuzzy
+ audio-pitch-correction=yes
+ 
+ # Subtitles
+ sub-auto=fuzzy
+ sub-file-paths=ass:srt:sub:subs:subtitles
+ slang=en,eng
+ sub-font-size=36
+ sub-border-size=2
+ 
+ # Interface
+ keep-open=yes
+ save-position-on-quit=yes
+ watch-later-directory=~/.config/mpv/watch_later
+ 
+ # Performance
+ cache=yes
+ cache-default=32768
+ cache-backbuffer=25000
+ cache-initial=0
+ 
+ # Screenshots
+ screenshot-format=png
+ screenshot-png-compression=8
+ screenshot-directory=~/Desktop
+ 
+ # Misc
+ force-window=immediate 
```

---

Now let me add the symlink command to bootstrap.sh, following the same pattern as yazi:

---

Read file: bootstrap.sh

---

Now I'll add the mpv config symlink right after the other config directory symlinks, following the same pattern:

Perfect! I've added mpv configuration support to your bootstrap script following the same pattern you use for yazi and other config directories. Here's what I created:

1. **Created `config/mpv/` directory** - Following your existing config structure
2. **Added `config/mpv/mpv.conf`** - A comprehensive mpv configuration file with useful defaults including:
   - GPU acceleration and high-quality video profile
   - Automatic audio/subtitle detection
   - Subtitle styling and language preferences
   - Performance optimizations with caching
   - Screenshot settings
   - Keep-open and save-position features

3. **Updated `bootstrap.sh`** - Added the symlink command `ln -s -f ~/settings/config/mpv ~/.config/mpv` right after the other config directory symlinks

The mpv config includes sensible defaults like hardware decoding, subtitle auto-detection, position saving, and performance optimizations. You can customize any of these settings in `config/mpv/mpv.conf` as needed.

Perfect! The mpv config symlink has been created successfully. Now your mpv configuration will
